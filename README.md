# Hand-Finger-Gesture-Recognition

This project focuses on distinguishing numbers represented by hand gestures using deep learning techniques for image classification tasks.
In this project, I explore various preprocessing techniques, including morphological transformations, and delve into data augmentation using data generators to enhance diversity of training dataset.
